How to Create Alerts in the Amazon ES cluster

Here we need to intergrate the AWS ES with SNS to set up Alerting.

Presteps:
step a:
	Create a SNS topic and create a mail id subscription
	copy the URN
Step b:
- 	Create a ec2 role with below policy 
	{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sns:Publish",
    "Resource": "<sns-topic-arn>"
  }]
}

Copy the SNS ARN which was created in the step 1 to Step 2


- Click the trust relationship

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "es.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}


Step 2:
		Login to Kibana
		select the Alerting option right side top corner else left navigation plane
step 3:
		click the monitor
			- Create monitor
			- Use query approch if you want to search the data
			sameple query 
			{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "firstname": {
                "query": "anand",
                "operator": "OR",
                "prefix_length": 0,
                "max_expansions": 50,
                "fuzzy_transpositions": true,
                "lenient": false,
                "zero_terms_query": "NONE",
                "auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query": true,
                "boost": 1
            }
        }
